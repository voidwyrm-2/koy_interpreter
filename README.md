# koy_interpreter
A (badly made) interpreter for the [Koy](https://github.com/pocco81/koy) data format

I was looking around on GitHub, saw Koy, and was like, "I know what I'm doing" (as of writing this it's days later because I forgot about it for a bit)

If Koy's creator sees this, I'm sorry, I know my code is a mess
